# temp_map

This project allows you to see the temperature of the global ocean at any point on Earth. Temperature data is uploaded by the user (.zip file).

Ocean temperature data, after downloading, goes to the server, which is implemented here:
https://github.com/DmShko/temp_map_server.

 There, the data is processed, as a result of which a new photo is created with temperature zones highlighted in a certain color.
- Red - > 35 degrees Celsius.
-Orange - 30 degrees Celsius.
- Green - more than 20
-Turquoise - more than 10
-Blue - from 0 to 10 degrees Celsius.
 
The project was developed by Dmytro Dhevchenko.
